# How to Host Your Website for Free with Vercel

This project is built with Next.js, which can be easily deployed for free using **Vercel**, the company that created Next.js. Their free tier is perfect for portfolio websites, blogs, and many other web applications, and it **does not require a credit card** to get started.

The deployment process connects your GitHub repository to Vercel, allowing for automatic deployments whenever you push new changes.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Ensure Your Code is on GitHub

Your project's code must be in a GitHub repository. If you haven't done so already, you can follow these general steps:

1.  **Create a new repository** on [GitHub](https://github.com/new). You can make it public or private.
2.  **Push your project code** to that repository.

### Step 2: Deploy with Vercel

1.  **Go to the Vercel Website**: [vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup)
2.  **Sign Up**: Sign up for a new account using your GitHub account. This is the easiest and most recommended option.
3.  **Import Your Project**: Once you've signed up and are on your Vercel dashboard, click the "Add New..." button and select "Project".
4.  **Connect to GitHub**: Vercel will ask for permission to access your GitHub repositories. Grant access, and then find and select the GitHub repository for your portfolio website.
5.  **Configure and Deploy**:
    *   Vercel will automatically detect that your project is a Next.js app and configure all the build settings for you. You don't need to change anything.
    *   Click the **"Deploy"** button.

That's it! Vercel will build your project and deploy it. After a minute or two, your website will be live on a `*.vercel.app` URL. You can also connect a custom domain for free from your Vercel project dashboard.
